# Web UI

This is a slightly modified version of Harvester's default built-in Web UI.

In Your own implementation, You could download the Harvester API using the
default endpoint "http://<domain>:<port>/api" which should automatically be
pointing to the correct API endpoint on the Harvester HTTP server. In this
example, the port is hardcoded as 8080 (which is the default port used) but
Your mileage may vary.

You are highly encouraged to build Your own visualization based on the raw
data (which is, as can be seen, in JSON format) instead of using the silly
turntable animation. The whole point of this default Web UI was to have a
sample users could mimic ... Harvester is mainly supposed to be a API ;)
