# Sample clients for Traktor Harvester

These are some sample clients in various languages You can use with [Traktor Harvester](https://www.disconova.com/utu/traktor-metadata/5-beta.zip) *(which is considered "perpetually Beta", if you know what I mean)*.

Some users thought the point of the v0.5 upgrade of the Harvester was the silly visualization built into the server ... nothing could be further from the truth. The actual point instead was to create a simple API for other developers to toy with and create their own implementations around it. 

So... here are some samples for Y'all. Enjoy, expand, go wild. *Peace out!*
